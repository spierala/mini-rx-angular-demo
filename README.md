-   🚀 See MiniRx in action in the [Angular demo](https://angular-demo.mini-rx.io)

MiniRx provides simple yet powerful state management with **[Feature Stores](https://spierala.github.io/mini-rx-store/docs/fs-quick-start)**.
To manage state at large scale you can use the classic **[Redux API](https://spierala.github.io/mini-rx-store/docs/redux)**.

The Demo uses both the Redux API and the Feature Stores:

-   Todos: Feature Store
-   Products and Cart: Redux
-   User: Feature Store
